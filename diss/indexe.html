                    In the modern information technology industry, databases play a major role in
                    building automated systems of any complexity and scale. Design quality and
                    building, as well as the efficiency of using the database directly affects the overall
                    functioning of the system or software complex.

                <p>
                    Each database is defined by a structure that is nothing more than a set of instructions on
                    SQL language, or rather one of its dialects. Thus, the process of analyzing the quality of the base
                    structure
                    data is to analyze its SQL code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Already there are systems that perform this task for other programming languages, but it is
                    the creation of an automated system for analyzing the quality of the database structure (SFAD)
                    developers and administrators to significantly increase the efficiency of their work and on time
                    respond to errors at the stage of building databases.

                    is the key to the success of the entire project. Proper and timely embedding of this stage in the
                    process
                    Writing code can significantly save both time and financial resources. Considering,
                    how widely, for the moment, are SQL databases being used, a tool that allows
                    comprehensively assess the quality and coherence of written SQL-code, can be extremely in demand.

                    to meet large software systems, static analysis is particularly relevant.

                    In order to more fully reveal the essence of the automated quality analysis system
                    database structure, it is necessary to give definitions to the basic concepts that are encountered

                    Static code analysis is the process of identifying logical and stylistic errors.
                    in the source code. Static analysis to some extent is analogous to the code review process (code
                    review), but in automated form. Usually in practice both approaches are used, since each
                    has a number of advantages [3].
                </p>
                <p>
                    It should be noted that the code analysis process itself is the final stage of the chain of
                    successive
                    operations. It is based on lexical and syntactic parsing procedures, the implementation of which
                    depends on the specifics of the text, in this case, the program code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lexical analysis or parsing is the process of analyzing and recognizing certain
                    elements or their groups (tokens) in the input set or sequence of characters, for their
                    subsequent identification and allocation of tokens (tokenization). In the general case in the
                    lexical process
                    analysis of input data is a stream of characters, and output - a set of classified tokens
                    (classification may have different levels of complexity) [1].
                </p>
                <p>
                    The syntax analysis is the process of processing a set of tokens (in general, tokens)
                    a certain formal language with its grammar. This process is performed syntactically.
                    analyzer (parser), which accepts the input of the work of the previous lexical
                    analysis. The output of the parse is a syntax tree or tree
                    parse, which is the entire syntactic structure of the analyzed sequence
                    characters [2].
                </p>
                <p>
                    A bunch of lexical and parser is used in many areas.
                    programming and not only writing them manually is quite time-consuming process
                    therefore, in many software products, compilers, interpreters, etc. are used
                    analyzer generators [8].
                </p>
                <p>
                    Generators of lexical and syntactic analyzers take as input lexical and syntactic
                    the structure of the language in some formal representation, at the output we get the source code of
                    the lexer
                    and a parser in one of the programming languages (the language depends on the selected generator).

                <p>
                    As you can see, the analysis of the SQL code of the database structure consists of several
                    consecutive
                    transformations of the source code and its further processing. The full algorithm of the

                <p class="title">Techniques and methodologies of static analysis</p>
                <p>
                    One of the most important techniques of static code analysis is data flow analysis. This is a method
                    gathering information about a possible set of calculated values and options for their use in various
                    points of the program [4]. The data obtained from this process is often used when
                    program optimization. This process is possible through the construction and analysis of the control
                    flow graph (CFG) (fig. 2.).
                </p>
                <p class="text-center">
                    <img id="cfg-img" src="../img/cfg.png"/>

                    <span>Figure 2 - Control flow graph</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The CFG is a representation using the graph of all the paths of the program. In the flow graph
                    control, each node represents a base unit, that is, a rectilinear piece of code without any
                    transitions. Directed edges are used to represent links and transitions between basic
                    blocks in the control flow. In most notations, there are two specially marked blocks: input
                    the block through which the control enters the flow graph, and the output block through which the
                    entire
                    control flow [5].
                </p>
                <p>
                    Analyzing such a structure allows determining the places for calculating the values of certain
                    variables
                    identify the code blocks in which these values are used. Thus, it is possible to trace the path
                    variables and their values according to the program and identify vulnerabilities or opportunities
                    for optimization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also worth noting is the technique of matching pattern matching. She is in
                    compiling a list of certain anti-patterns of the use of certain language constructions and
                    identifying in the source code fragments corresponding to them.

                <p>
                    For the SQL language in the context of describing the structure of the database, you can give an
                    example of identifying
                    stylistic and logical inconsistencies by pattern matching. In figure 3
                    There are two options for describing tables. In the first case, a logical error was made, since the
                    field
                    the “users” table implicitly refers to the “roles” table - the foreign key is missing. In the second
                    case
                    a stylistic error was made because the foreign key was created, but the field name was not set
                    appropriately
                    standards.

                    Similarly, any formalized rule can be analyzed. Based on the specification
                    SQL and recommendations made by the developer community can form the necessary list
                    of these rules, for the effective operation of the automated system of static analysis.

                <p>
                    In this paper, the basic concepts and subject of the master's project were described.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An analysis was made of existing solutions, following which we can conclude that
                    moment of universal decisions on the analysis of the quality of the database structure in the
                    context of any dialect
                    SQL is not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Were also considered techniques of static code analysis, which will be used in the development of
                    SFAD. The list of applied techniques will need to be expanded to cover aspects of the analysis,
                    missing in existing systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to the results of the work carried out, it is planned to continue research and practical
                    application
                    achievements.
